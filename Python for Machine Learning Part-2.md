### Examples of print()

```python
print(1,2,3,4) # 1 2 3 4

print(1,2,3, sep='/') # 1/2/3

print(1,2,3, sep='Jai mata di') # 1 Jai mata di2Jai mata di3

print(1, end="Jai shree ram") # 1 Jai shree ram
```

### Variable Binding -

- Values stored in variable that process called as `Variable Binding.`

```python
fnum = 100
fnum    # 100
fnum    # 100 -> always printing fnum as value is 100 i.e. variable binding example
```

- Variable binding have 2 types -
  - Single assessment (a=5)
  - Multiple assessment (a=b=c=5, a,b,c=5,6,7)

> NOTE* - python variable binding increase our program "efficiency" & also increases our typing speed that hel to minimum time to program.
 
```python
a,b,c=2,3,4
b    # 3

a=b=c=5
c    # 5 
```
