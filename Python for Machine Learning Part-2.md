## Python for machine learning Part 2 -


### Examples of print()

```python
print(1,2,3,4) # 1 2 3 4

print(1,2,3, sep='/') # 1/2/3

print(1,2,3, sep='Jai mata di') # 1 Jai mata di2Jai mata di3

print(1, end="Jai shree ram") # 1 Jai shree ram
```

### Variable Binding -

- Values stored in variable that process called as `Variable Binding.`

```python
fnum = 100
fnum    # 100
fnum    # 100 -> always printing fnum as value is 100 i.e. variable binding example
```

- Variable binding have 2 types -
  - Single assessment (a=5)
  - Multiple assessment (a=b=c=5, a,b,c=5,6,7)

> NOTE* - python variable binding increase our program "efficiency" & also increases our typing speed that hel to minimum time to program.
 
```python
a,b,c=2,3,4
b    # 3

a=b=c=5
c    # 5 
```

### Type Conversion -

- Type Conversion have 2 types -
  - Implicit Type Conversion
    - Python interpreter witohut programmer help directly solve 'int' + 'float' value output as 'float' value without showing error.
  - Explicit Type Conversion
    - As programmer or our responsibilty to told interpreter that time we required type conversion. 

```python
# Implicit Type Conversion
5+4.5    # 9.5
```

### Comment - 

- `#` this is comment
- Comnment means, is line of code that <b>ignore</b> by interpreter or compiler.

> NOTE* - Comments `#` make best whats about in current program or project. It's best practice to showing info about what in that part.
