### Part 1 :
---------------------------


#### Q. What is programming? <br>
=> Human talk with Machine, that required language for talking called <b>Programming</b> or <b>Programming language.</b>
<br>

### print() -

- print() - "()" is indicates function of all programming language.<br>

#### Q. What is Function?
=> 
- You can give as a input, its return output based upon a logic called <b> Function.</b>
  - E.g. Function concept is similar for S/W as well as H/W. fan, projector... etc.
- Simple, <b>`Function means gives Input & retured Output without knowing internal main logic.`</b>
- for print() you don't required how print work internally <i>(means its function)</i>.
- print() is readymade, you can directly used it, without knowing internal logic, for programmer easy working.
<br>

E.g.  
``` python
print(4)  # 4
print(4.5) # 4.5
print(Salman Khan) # SyntaxError : invalid syntax
 # bcz, we always write text in string => " or '
print("Salman Khan") # Salman Khan
	  
print(1,"Salman Khan") # 1 Salman Khan
print(1: "Salman Khan") # SyntaxError : invalid syntax
 # print rewured  2 inputs seperated by comma "," only.

print(1,2,3,4,5,6) # 1 2 3 4 5 6
 # print input have "No" any upper limit.
print() # printing Blank as output
 # print input minimum limit have 1 input.

### Data Types - 

<b>Data</b> :
   - Whatsapp data - Chat & Messages
   - Zomato data - Restro details, order details, menu
   - Ola data - Pickup point, destination, fare, driver details
   - Instagram data - Photos, profile info, status
   - Youtube data - Videos, search terms, comments
<br>

> * NOTE :
>   - Different platforms have different types of data. <br>
>   - E.g. Youtube main data is videos, Instagram main data is photos, Whatsapp main data is text. <br>
>   - Different different data called as "Data Types"
<br>

</b>Data types</b> :
```python
# int : We (human) speak its Numbers
print(2) # 2

# float : We speak its as Decimal
print(2.4) # 2.4

# string : We speak its as Text
print("Haldia") # Haldia
```
> * NOTE : Python can <b>inheriently support string</b>, but C can't support string.
```python
# bool : boolean 1 and 0
print(True) # True
print(False) # False
print(false) # NameError: name 'false' is not defined
```
Thats boolean example shows python is a `case sensitive language` (Uppercase & Lowercase for python are not similar)
```python
# Complex number : 
print(5+6j) # (5+6j)
```
> * NOTE :
>   - Python is the only programming language that `"Natively support of complex numbers."`
>   - We can build S/W based upon complex number we choosen `Python language` only.

#### Data types : int, float, string, bool, complex
<br>

### User Input -

E.g. - Daily life S/W's using <b>user input</b>
 - Whatsapp : give msg as a input.
 - Youtube : search, comments... are inputs from users.
 - Ola : destination
 - Phone lock, Face look -> required user inputs.
<br>

E.g. - S/W's that <b>not required</b> user input.
 - clock, calender... etc.
<br>



  
### Static Vs Dynamic - 
>NOTE : All overs desktop apps. website are have only 2 types (S/W's) -
><b>Static</b> and
><b>Dyanamic</b>

- Static :- S/W's that not required user input.
   - E.g. - Clock, Calendar...
- Dynamic :- S/W's that required user inputs.
   - E.g. - Youtube, Instagram, Whatsapp...
<br>


#### Program or user and Static or Dynamic?  
```python 
print("Haldia")
```

Q. Above <i>"print("Haldia")"</i> is "<b>program</b>" or not ?<br>
  - It's proper program bez, it have definated output is print on screen.

Q. Question is <i>"print("Haldia")"</i> is static or Dynamic? Are you getting Confuse between a programer & User?<br>
  - Static S/W is that S/W they gives by programmer (not by User).
  - User can only view output. User can't interact or make changes. i.e.Static S/W.
  - E.g. News website read without any login is static example.

### input() -

```python
input()
# >>> Pappu # this enter by the user
# >>> 'Pappu' #  this output printed on screen
```

```python
# user friendly code
input("Enter your name")
# >>> Enter your namekeju
# >>> 'Keju'
```
