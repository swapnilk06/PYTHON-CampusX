#### Q. What is programming? <br>
=> Human talk with Machine, that required language for talking called <b>Programming</b> or <b>Programming language.</b>

<br>

### print() -

- print() - "()" is indicates function of all programming language.

<br>

#### Q. What is Function?
=> 
- You can give as a input, its return output based upon a logic called <b> Function.</b>
  - E.g. Function concept is similar for S/W as well as H/W. fan, projector... etc.
- Simple, `<b> Function means gives Input & retured Output without knowing internal main logic.<b>`
- for print() you don't required how print work internally <i>(means its function)</i>.
- print() is readymade, you can directly used it, without knowing logic for easy working.

<br>

E.g.  
``` python
print(4)  # 4
print(4.5) # 4.5
print(Salman Khan) # SyntaxError : invalid syntax
 # bcz, we always write text in string => " or '
print("Salman Khan") # Salman Khan
	  
print(1,"Salman Khan") # 1 Salman Khan
print(1: "Salman Khan") # SyntaxError : invalid syntax
 # print rewured  2 inputs seperated by comma "," only.

print(1,2,3,4,5,6) # 1 2 3 4 5 6
 # print input have "No" any upper limit.
print() # printing Blank as output
 # print input minimum limit have 1 input.

### Data Types - 

E.g. Whatsapp data - Chat & Messages
     Zomato data - Restro details, order details, menu
	 Ola data - Pickup point, destination, fare, driver details
	 Instagram data - Photos, profile info, status
	 Youtube data - Videos, search terms, comments
	 
NOTE : - Different platforms have different types of data. 
       - E.g. Youtube main data is videos, Instagram main data is photos, Whatsapp main data is text.
	   - Different different data called as "Data Types".
	   
Data types - are these data types of language can be handle.

- int : We (human) speak Numbers.<.br>
print(2) // 2

- float : We speak Decimal.</br>
print(2.4) // 2.4

- string : We speak text;/
print("Haldia") // Haldia

> *NOTE : Python can <b>inheriently support String.</b> JS & C are not support string.

- Bool : </br>
print(True) // True

```
Python is a case sensitive language (Uppercase & Lowercase for python are not similar)
E.g.
	print(False) // False
	print(false) // NameError: name 'false' is not defined
```	

- Complex number :
print(5+6j)
	   

> *NOTE : Python is the "only programming lamguage that Natively support of comlex number".
- Data types : int, float, string, bool, complex


User Input -

E.g. Daily life S/W's using user input -
     - Whatsapp :- give msg as a input.
     - Youtube :- search, comments... are inputs from users.
	 - Phone lock, Face look :- required user inputs.


E.g. Daily S/W's that not required User input -
     - Clock
     - Calender
	 
Static Vs Dynamic - 
>NOTE : All overs desktop apps. website are have only 2 types - <b>Static</b> and <b>Dyanamic</b>

- Static :- S/W's that not required user input.
  E.g. - Clock
- Dynamic :- S/W's that gives user inputs
  E.g. - Youtube, Instagram, Whatsapp...
	   
<br>
```python 
print("Haldia")
```
Q. Above <i>"print("Haldia")"</i> is "<b>program</b>" or not ?
- It's proper program definated output print on screen.
- Question: It's static or Dynamic? - Are you getting Confuse between a programer & User?
  - Static S/W is that S/W they gives by programmer (not by User)
  - User can only view output. User can't interact or make changes.i.e.Static S/W.
