Q. What is programming?
=> Human talk with Machine this language called Programming.

print() ==> "()" is indicates function of all programming language.

Q. What is Function?
=> - You can give any input & its return output based upon a logic.
   E.g. Function is also available S/W as well as H/W.
        - Fan, projector etc.
   - Simple, Function means give Input & retured Output without knowing internal main logic.
   E.g. print - you don't required how print work internally.
        - print() is redemate, you can used it only without knowing logic for easy working.


print() -

E.g.  print(4)  // 4
      print(4.5) // 4.5
	  print(Salman Khan) // SyntaxError : invalid syntax
      print("Salman Khan") // Salman Khan
	  
E.g.  print(1,"Salman Khan") // 1 Salman Khan
      print(1: "Salman Khan") // SyntaxError : invalid syntax
	  - print gives 2 inputs seperated by "," its print all of.
	 
E.g.  print(1,2,3,4,5,6) // 1 2 3 4 5 6
      - No any upper limit for print() inputs
	  print() // "printing Blank"
	  -  Minimum limit have 1 input

Data Types - 

E.g. Whatsapp data - Chat & Messages
     Zomato data - Restro details, order details, menu
	 Ola data - Pickup point, destination, fare, driver details
	 Instagram data - Photos, profile info, status
	 Youtube data - Videos, search terms, comments
	 
NOTE : - Different platforms have different types of data. 
       - E.g. Youtube main data is videos, Instagram main data is photos, Whatsapp main data is text.
	   - Different different data called as "Data Types".
	   
Data types - are these data types of language can be handle.

int - We (human) speak Numbers.
print(2) // 2

float - We speak Decimal.
print(2.4) // 2.4

string - We speak text.
print("Haldia") // Haldia


NOTE : Python can inheriently support String. JS & C are not support string.


Bool -
print(True) // True


Python is a case sensitive language (Uppercase & Lowercase for python are not similar)
E.g.
	print(False) // False
	print(false) // NameError: name 'false' is not defined
	

Complex number -
print(5+6j)
	   

NOTE : Python is the "only programming lamguage that Natively support of comlex number".
 - Data types : int, float, string, bool, complex


User Input -

E.g. Daily life S/W's using user input -
     - Whatsapp :- give msg as a input.
     - Youtube :- search, comments... are inputs from users.
	 - Phone lock, Face look :- required user inputs.


E.g. Daily S/W's that not required User input -
     - Clock
	 - Calender
	 
Static Vs Dynamic - 
NOTE : desktop app. Website are only 2 types -
       - Static :- S/W's that not required user input.
	   E.g. - Clock
	   - Dynamic :- S/W's that gives user inputs
	   E.g. - Youtube, Instagram, Whatsapp...
	   

print("Haldia")

- above is program or not ?
- It's proper program definated output print on screen.
- Question: It's static or Dynamic? - Are you getting Confuse between a programer & User?
  - Static S/W is that S/W they gives by programmer (not by User)
  - User can only view output. User can't interact or make changes.i.e.Static S/W.
